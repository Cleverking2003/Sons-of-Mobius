###Rethenian CSR
POLITICS_RCR_PALLASOV_DESCRIPTION:0 "Юрий Александрович Лебедев родился в семье потомственного военного и преподавательницы университета. С детства он был окружен детьми социалистов, сближаясь с ними, изучая труды Генриха Катцера и играя в "войнушку", не подозревая, что многие из них станут его товарищами спустя чуть более чем десять лет. Тем не менее, отцовская хватка завела будущего революционера в армию Ретенской Республики в период окончания Великой войны и начала Первой войны Роботника. Он застал падение родной страны перед неумолимым натиском Роботника, и ему же будучи командиром взвода пришлось объединять в большой отряд своих соотечественников, чтобы вести партизанскую войну с захватчиком. Таким образом, под псевдонимом "Палласов" он стал одним из командиров Борцов за Свободу Ретении, и под его командованием Красная гвардия Борцов за Свободу освободила Сталегор от ставленников Роботника. Уже после освобождения страны от Роботника товарищ Палласов был одним из самых влиятельных лиц в стране, возглавляя левую фракцию неустойчивого коалиционного правительства. Хладный Голод, обрушение промышленного производства, конфликты за земельную собственность и последующий крах правительства привел к гражданской войне, которая началась вслед за Новогодней революцией, когда Палласов отдал красногвардейцам команду открыть огонь по правительственным войскам, пытавшимся разогнать забастовку на заводе "Арсенал".\n\nПалласов активно руководил Красной армией и государственными органами советского государства, зачастую по-прежнему выходя на поле боя и применяя врожденные магнетические способности, что очень скоро истощило его нервную систему. Тяжелая болезнь застала Палласова вскоре после разгрома реакционных сил Ретении в 3233 году, выведя председателя Совнаркома из политической жизни на два с половиной года. К сожалению, в его отсутствие назревал раскол в правящей партии РПРА, и в условиях внутрипартийных конфликтов никто не смог остановить дезинтеграционные процессы в местными Советах. Теперь, когда Палласов вернулся с лечения, он готов продолжать борьбу за дело освобождения рабочих всего Мобиуса."
###Jackals
IFINITE_DESC:0 "Infinite the Jackal, formerly known as the "Ultimate Mercenary", is believed to be the only saviour of his own nation, damned and humiliated by the United Federation. This jackal was born in poverty as millions of his compatriots. His homeland was no more than a source of cheap oil and gas for the United Federation ruled by puppet king Kamil II, and becoming a mercenary was one of a few ways to earn a living, and the talented boy called Zero choose that way. Zero outplayed all of his opponents and became a leader of his own squad, later known as the Jackal Squad according to GUN databases. \n\nThe government of the United Federation valued his skills and achievements of his squad and offered Zero the contract he could never reject. Thus, the Jackal Squad became one of the elite GUN task groups, carrying out tasks all around the world from Soumerica to Rethenian Civil War, where Zero grew to hate all kinds of socialist ideas after one of his partners was slaughtered during assassination attempts on one of Red Army leaders. Later, he got an objective to raid Eggman's base. The Jackal Squad succeeded and captured a misterious artifact - the Phantom Ruby. Zero refused to give it to GUN ambassador, feeling enchanted by the Ruby. The price he paid for this was terrible...\n\nSoon after this moment, the Jackal Squad was sent on another mission in Bharatsha, where it was deceived and destroyed by GUN batallion and Team Dark led by Shadow the Hedgehog. Zero was the only jackal to survive luckily. Also, he managed to save the Ruby, enforcing connection between himself and this artifact. When he returned to his home county, he saw growing tension between the king and the people. After Jackal people rised against Kamil II, Zero used the power of Phantom Ruby to lead revolutionaries and overthrow the puppet king, killing him and his family. By washing his hands with royal blood, Zero realized that this is the fisrt act of revenge against the United Federation. This jackal believed to have opportunity to avenge his squad and himself and to avenge his people. By rising to power, giving up his own unsightly face and letting go the old himself, the weak one, he obtained the power. He was reborn. He became Infinite.\n\nPortrait based on art by JamoART"
###Acorns
POLITICS_KING_ZOG_DESC:0 "His Majesty, King Maximillian Acorn, as known as Maximillian the Cursed. Himself, he is not destined to be hated by his people, but the period of his ruling is. Being 58 years old, King Max has his own health collapsed by two wars and assassination attempt. He led the country through the worst times of its history: the Great War with Overlanders, First Robotnik War when the Kingdom was toppled by Julian Kintobor, known as Ivo Robotnik. After the end of First Robotnik War, his throne was restored, but the vortex of history approaches the old king with dramatically degrading health, threatening his heirs and the whole House of Acorns. It is a question of time if Maximillian the Cursed dies on his throne or abdigates in order to give his title to hes newly revealed son and legitimate heir, prince Elias Acorn whose childish nature can barely cope with the chaos inevitably approaching the nation."
###Eggman
POLITICS_EGGMAN_DESC:0 "Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik is rightful and devoted successor of Robotnik Prime's cause. For Mobius Prime, doctor Eggman is like a bolt from a blue appearing from literally nothing. But still, he had a consistent story of his own, different from Robotnik Prime. \n\nIn fact, this Robotnik came from alternative dimension. Doctor Ivo Robotnik was born in Overlanders' world. Both Robotnik Prime and Eggman come from an antient line of human scientists known as Kintobor. Julian Kintobor was born in 3189. He never was a fair person - he framed his teacher Nate Morgan so as to take over his laboratory; later he used his post of weaponry engineer of Overlanders' Empire during the Great War to experiment his weapons on his own compatriots; after being brought to trial, he escaped and offered his services to Acorns, making it possible for them to win the war over Overlanders; finally, he staged a coup d'état against Acorns and conquered Mobius. The difference in timelines occured in the year of 3232, when Eggman roboticized himself to defeat Freedom Fighters, unlike Robotnik Prime who stood in his biological body. This allowed Eggman, known as Robo-Robotnik, to survive the destruction of his body in the final fight against Sonic and Freedom Fighters. He managed to transport his digital consciousness to an incomplete and derelict space station he had created for other purposes. Robo-Robotnik prepared another plan of revenge. A long time after his putative death, he created another robotic body, constructed nuclear warheads and destroyed Mobotropolis of his dimension, wiping out Sonic and the entire royal family from his universe. \n\nRobo-Robotnik had already known a lot about alternative dimensions - it was even happened to meet Robotnik Prime. Both Robotniks were able to travel through different universes, and meeting with Robotnik Prime inspired Robo-Robotnik a lot. But when he destroyed his enemies, he lost the sense of living. But by this moment he had found up that Robotnik Prime was destroyed. Robo-Robotnik decided to "fill the void" of another world and invaded Mobius Prime, taking over remnants of fallen Robotnik Empire in his newly created organic body. In this body he became known as doctor Eggman. Considering his experience of roboticization and destroying Freedom Fighters in his own dimension, doctor Eggman has become more dangerous enemy than his predecessor..."
