The ultimate goal of the operation will be to dismantle the local insurgent operations headquarters, the location of which is not yet known. Dr. Eggman considers this operation a "Holy War against the Savages" and says that no casualties should be feared in the name of destroying the enemy insurgency.\n\n§YFreedom Figters' Activity:§! §R[?EGG.ff_activity]%§!"

Elias inherited a great deal of social and political problems from his father, King Maximilian the Cursed. The Second Robotnik War was the clearest testimony of all the weaknesses of the Acorn absolute monarchy. Tired of the arbitrary rule of the king, many sectors of society saw in Elias' ascension to the throne not hope, but as the continuation of the nightmare. General Amadeus Prower rallied democratically minded officers and intellectuals around him. The Southern Baronies, devastated by war and unaided by the King, remember their rebellious past. The socialist unions in the Titanium Belt are organising a militia and preparing a general strike. If the right measures are not taken, the Kingdom of Acorn will very soon meet its end on the scaffold...\n\nLoyalty to £crown!§CElias Acorn§!: §C[?KOA.loyalty_elias]§!\n£rifles!§ORepublican§! political power: §O[?KOA.prower_power]§!\n£rabbit!§YConfederate§! political power: §Y[?KOA.baron_power]§!\n£red_star!§RSocialist§! political power: §R[?KOA.union_power]§!"

The industrialization was the original intended goal, but other uses have become apparent. The nation’s infrastructure is in dire straits and this could be used to fund improvements to our transportation network. Furthermore, we could use this money to hire experienced mercenaries to supplement some of the untrained militia and improve our chances against a possible United Federation assault. Even within the industrialization we still have to decide whether to fund our civilian or military industry.\n\nGolden surplus: £gold!§Y[?inf_gold_storage] thousand kilostones§!"
