  koa.100.t:0 "The Cursed King"
  koa.100.d:0 "King Maximilian Acorn had been the absolute monarch of his kingdom for longer than many young mobians could remember. He was immortalized in old photographs and hazy memories as a symbol for strength and unity in times of strife. The Overlanders who fled to the United Federation would recognize King Max as the warrior-king who defeated Overlord Charlemagne in single combat and won the Great War for the good of his people.\nThe years have not been kind to Max. In the time since that short-lived victory against the Overland, the monarch had suffered tragedy after tragedy. Grave betrayal at the hands of his Warlord Robotnik, mystical enslavement in the service of his court wizard Naugus, the lost of his ability to walk in a grievous injury, and only barely surviving an attempt on his life at the hands of a royal guard's impersonator.\nA difficult life with strains beyond that which all but the most tenacious could bear have robbed King Maximilian the Cursed of his youth and wizened him beyond his years. His mind was not spared from the ravages of these hardships, but he knew in his heart that his time on the throne was nearing its end.\nHis son Elias would be the next king. He was inexperienced, but Max knew that Elias had the strong will needed to lead their people through the coming dark times. King Maz had no doubts that his daughter Sally would be a model queen if anything were to happen to Elias, but tradition dictated she must wed before assuming power. Now that Prince Elias was an eligible heir, Max no longer sought to pressure Sally into what should always have been her own decision.\nOr perhaps he discovered a spark of sentimentality in his otherwise bitter bouts of senility. Max had only the best intentions for his children and his nation, but intent meant little in the grand scheme of history. Only cause and effect bore fruit."

  koa.101.t:0 "A Return to Industry"
  koa.101.d:0 ""Rebuild" was the word on everyones' minds after the city of New Mobotropolis became a protective umbrella against the continued onslaught of Eggman's aggression. The damage the madman wrought across the world was severe, and now there would be time to heal where the thought of recovery once looked impossible. It seemed as though, for the first time in years, the Kingdom of Acorn truly had a second chance to pick itself up off the ground and grow anew.\nNICOLE did the heavy lifting, but that did not mean the work was done. The Kingdom of Acorn had always been wary of reckless expansion and industrialization, witnessing firsthand the ruinous path it led the Overland towards. Increasing the industrial capacity of the nation without compromising the health and safety of its citizens would be a slow and deliberate process. There was no shortage of people looking for work once the gears of the economy began to churn like they used to.\nA difficulty encountered in the Kingdom's reindustrialization program was the rise of organized labor movements. Large groups of workers, many congregated in the former Overland territories of the North, have formed cliques and been less than cooperative in regard to the crown's production quotas. The King has been patiently ignoring their less violent demonstrations and protests, but his patience is starting to wear thin. Many things are up to negotiation, but the needs of the nation are not."
  koa.101.a:0 "What on Mobius is a union?"

  koa.102.t:0 "Organizing the National Guard"
  koa.102.d:0 "Amadeus and Rosemary Prower returning from their exile to Bem space and the modernization of the Royal Army were both a long time coming. Whereas the Prowers spent over a decade in relative peace before the Black Arms and Xorda burned their home away from home to cinders, the Acorn War Ministry suffered from centuries of stagnation and neglect. Sticking to the traditional bias against industrialization and the firearms ban set forth by past monarchs have left the Kingdom of Acorn woefully outclassed in a modern war for survival.\nTo General Prower's shock upon resuming command of his former post, the most reliable weapons the Royal Army had were bows and arrows! Relics and toys of little use during the Great War and worthless against Eggman's horde, to say nothing of how quaint they were in comparison to the planet-scouring superweapons brought to bear over Argentum. Amadeus knew that his task of forming a national guard would be challenging when he accepted the charge from his King, but he underestimated how little had improved while he was gone.\n"The more things change," mused Amadeus, "The more we must adapt to overcome."\nThis discontentment would not, however, prevent the famous "Conductor of the Battlefield" who resisted the Overland occupation of Mobotropolis from performing his solemn duty. If anything, his desire for change was what drove him forward. With the aid of the Kingdom's citizenry and the continued support of the monarchy, General Prower hoped to secure a new age of peace and prosperity for the people and his family."
  koa.102.a:0 "Good to have you back, General."

  koa.103.t:0 "Legacy of the Source"
  koa.103.d:0 "Until recently, the Source of All was the Acorn line's greatest asset and most well-guarded secret. Only members of the royal family were made aware that a shimmering pool of gold and silver rested beneath the catacombs of old Castle Acorn. Those who were next in line to rule the kingdom would submerge their bodies in the mystical energies of the Source, granting them inspired visions and the alien materials that would be forged into their crown and symbols of office.\nThat was until Castle Acorn and the city around it was consumed in atomic fire. The ceremonial pool that hosted the Source of All was immediately vaporized, leaving King Max's crown and sword as the only remnants of what was once the Acorn family's wondrous heritage. These two relics would be exploited by enemies of the kingdom, until the Crown and Sword of Acorn were destroyed before their righteous qualities could be defiled further.\nWith that, the Acorns' link to Source of All was utterly extinguished. Elias and Sally were to be the first Acorns in generations not to be graced by a bonding experience with the Source, leaving Maximilian with no small amount of uncertainty over the future. Would his children have all of the knowledge they needed to weather the oncoming storms?\nMaximilian did not know, and he had no Source from which to draw the truth; his wellspring of answers had run dry."
  koa.103.a:0 "That's one Deus Ex Machina down the drain."

  koa.104.t:0 "Mobotropolis Reawakens"
  koa.104.d:0 "The original Mobotropolis was no more. After being recaptured by Eggman, the capital was moved to Knothole, home of the Freedom Fighters. Though intended to be a temporary affair until we could retake Mobotropolis, the city, known in its final days as “Robotropolis”, was nuked by the United Federation. We still manage to siphon the contained fallout and refine it into rings.\nKnothole would remain the capital of our Kingdom until an assault by the Eggman Empire. Around the same time, one of Eggman’s rogue minions, ADAM, constructed a city composed entirely of nanites. His plan was foiled, but not without cost. Most notably, the life of Freedom Fighter Tommy Turtle. The advanced AI NICOLE, however, was able to take control of the city and convert it into a near-exact replica of Mobotropolis before the war.\nThe King was amazed by her accomplishments, but the city lacked much of the factories that were operational during the Great War. He wandered the halls of his castle, looking for the AI, until he remembered she could appear anywhere she was needed.\n“NICOLE, I require your assistance.”\nA hologram of a female lynx in a purple toga appeared before him.\n“What is your request, your majesty?”\nHer voice, though flat and neutral, sounded more lifelike every day. Max was not quite sure where the Freedom Fighters' artificial assistant came from, though it was not terribly important to him at this time.\n“NICOLE,” he said, “I will need you to expand the city. We need to get our industry back in order.”\n“Expand the city?” she asked with a look of concern. “With all due respect, my ability to protect the city is dependent on how many nanites are bound to structures and how far I can exert my control. We just finished construction, and doing an expansion could be--”\n“It would only be a minor expansion,” King Max interrupted. “Additional space for a few factories to be built at a later date. Is that within your capabilities?”\nNICOLE became static as she ran the numbers on her mainframe.\n“We can spare the material. One moment, please.”\nHer avatar dissolved in an instant. When the King had next surveyed the city, he noticed several buildings around New Mobotropolis were carefully rearranged, allowing for the space he requested without compromising the city’s defenses."
  koa.104.a:0 "Thank you once again, NICOLE."

  koa.105.t:0 "Shadows of the Baronies"
  koa.105.d:0 "Besides fanning the flames of future conflicts with the Overland, the Southern Baronies were the most long-standing consequence that came out of King George’s Folly. In order to win back the faith and goodwill of the people, George’s son Abraham handed out fiefdoms in the fertile South and promoted numerous landowning farmers to nobility overnight. The title of baron and the independence that came with it greatly increased the wealth and prosperity of the region, to the extent that the more influential barons conveniently forgot which crown they owed their title to.\nKeeping the more unruly barons in line would be a frequent headache for future regents, though no one could predict the extent of treachery they would sink to during the Great War. As a part of a gamble for outright secession, several barons conspired with the Overland to tear the Kingdom apart from within. These acts of treason were foiled, but the idea that the Acorns were “oppressing” the Baronies with their edicts was an old sentiment that would linger. Even when all that remained of the territories were scattered estates and ill-formed dreams of confederacy.\nNow that the Kingdom of Acorn is entering a new status quo, the remaining barons and their holdings will need to be carefully watched in order to prevent them from rebelling again."
  koa.105.a:0 "You can take the rabbit out of the South, but you can’t take the South out of the rabbit."

  koa.106.t:0 "From a Land Downunda"
  koa.106.d:0 "The King’s diplomatic turboprop plane soared above the colonial city of Priscilla. The port was once the jewel of Downunda, but it was left a ghost town after Robotnik’s late enforcer Crocbot stole the populace away and roboticized them for his own purposes. Purposes that, if rumors were to be believed, did not always align with that of his creator.\n“You could not resist giving your own machines a taste for betrayal, could you?” Max pondered bitterly as his craft landed in the flat plains at the edge of the Outback.\nKing Max was escorted from his vessel, and did a tour of the city’s restorations. Only half of the people who once lived there had returned, the rest having been lost as robians in the years that passed since. Immigrants from Northamer and Yurashia have made up for that number, fresh faces seeking new opportunities wherever they could be found.\nA red marsupial hopped in a vest hopped down the street and greeted the king with a bow.\n“G’day, yer majesty!” said Walt the Wallaby, leader of the Downunda Freedom Fighters. Behind him were the other members of his crew: Barby Koala, Wombat Stu, Guru Emu, and Bill Platypus. Each of them were brave, loyal soldiers; Max vaguely recalled the wombat fellow was a member of his secret service. “Enjoyin’ yer time in our neck of the woods?”\nKing Max nodded.\n“I trust the repairs to the city are going as per schedule?”\n“Ahead of schedule, sir! Why, I reckon the city will be right as rain by the end of the month!”\n“Excellent. I will leave the rest of the oversight to you, Walter. Keep up the good work.”\nThough the trip was brief, Maximilian Acorn was satisfied with his findings. The territory was not yet ready for war, but it could one day be a useful ally against the Eggman Empire."
  koa.106.a:0 "Ripper, mate!"

  koa.107.t:0 "Waning Favor of the Monarch"
  koa.107.d:0 "In spite of Prower's early successes at swaying the King into reform, suggestions beyond those related to defense were ignored. There were token concessions to the populist notions he put forward, but the audiences Amadeus got with his old friend and liege became scarce.\n"If I may speak freely, my king?"\nThe shift in tone drew Max out of the malaise that gripped him throughout their meeting.\n"You may," His Majesty said slowly.\nIt pained Amadeus to see the wise, heroic king who led the kingdom through the Great War brought to such a sorry state. Prematurely aged by injury, betrayed more times than any weaker heart could bear. Was it any wonder that the common folk called him "Max the Cursed"?\n"We've both been too busy to meet face-to-face as we used to."\n"The needs of the kingdom comes before such pleasantries, though the new defenses set in place by NICOLE will do well in warding off Robotnik and his hordes."\n"I agree. They will also give us the breathing room necessary to consider new ways of dealing with the growing discontent of the people."\nThe King raised a white, bushy eyebrow.\n"Another suggestion from your time on Argentum?" he asked warily.\n"Rosemary and I have been visiting the community center to lend an ear to public concerns. There are bright individuals who could aid our efforts, but they can only do so much as civilians."\nMax frowned. He did not like where this was going.\n"In fact, we proposed the election of a council to aid in the execution of your royal duties. I requested a copy of our notes be brought to your desk, but I can understand if it was mislaid--"\n"We will accept no such council," King Max intoned. Unable to stand, the king sat up in his chair. "We have seen your pleas to cede power to the masses and dismissed them justly."\n"Should the people have no say in how their kingdom is run?"\n"Letting our authority over the kingdom slip is what led us to disaster. We have reigned without a body of minders for generations, and we shall continue to do so. We have humored you before, Prower, but this is where the line is drawn."\n"But I--"\n"Enough!" the old king barked. No longer wistful, but livid. "You are dismissed."\nPrower opened his mouth to speak, but he left the audience chamber without another word said to the man who was once his benevolent ruler and comrade-in-arms."
  koa.107.a:0 "The Cursed King is not who he used to be."

  koa.108.t:0 "Across the Pond"
  koa.108.d:0 "The Eurish kingdom of Mercia have been the trusted allies of the Acorn dynasty for generations. While the country was lagging behind the times in technological advancements, its people had an impeccable record for honor and nobility. The late King O'Hedge was a tough, but fair regent who Max considered a friend. With the loss of the old king during Robotnik's reign of terror, the struggle of taking back the occupied Mercia was left to his young son, Robert.\nThere have been many trials and upheavals in the time since Mercia was founded. We have doubts that those troubles are over yet. King Robert, known to his loyal subjects as Rob O' the Hedge, is young and untested. A skilled ranger who is more at home in the sprawling expanses of Deerwood Forest than he is the court of Snottingham, there is concern that he is not up to the task of leading his nation out of its fragile state.\nRob has the support of the people. That much was certain when Max visited the country and saw the clear adoration in the eyes of his citizenry. Will that be enough to restore Mercia to a status worthy of its oldest title: The Grand Kingdom?"
  koa.108.a:0 "Snottingham is a silly name for a capital."

  koa.109.t:0 "President Wilson Responds"
  koa.109.d:0 "For those who had once been lost to the roboticizers or banished to myriad dimensions for the duration of the Robotnik War, it seemed that the world had changed overnight. Many who survived long enough to regain their old bodies and minds found themselves displaced in other ways, no longer with a homeland to call their own. Those lost years saw the fall of ancient nations and the rise of new ones to replace them, the largest of which lied under the surface of Mobius for ages untold.\nThe old kingdoms of North Efrika collapsed into brutal civil war and were torn apart by internal strife. Aside from the Kingdom of Leonus, all that remained of them were footnotes in the history of the United Federation. The U.F. were a sprawling ring of city-states that stretched across multiple continents, the inhabitants consisting primarily of the Overlanders' genetic relatives: Humans. While they were content with staying hidden beneath their fortified mountain bunkers for much of recent history, the looming threat of Doctor Eggman made continued isolation all but impossible.\nIn spite of Max's trepidations about the country when it was first unveiled years ago, President Herbert Wilson proved to be a refreshingly reasonable individual. He has been a dedicated ally against the Eggman Empire, knowing full well that it will take the cooperation of multiple nations to keep that despotic madman in check. King Maximilian Acorn was assured by Wilson that, in spite of the upcoming elections and the possibility of a new leader entering office, there should be no change in their alliance.\nWas that a fact, or merely wishful thinking? The fault of allying with a democracy was that "yes" today could become "no" tomorrow, as one leader with a strict set of principles would eventually be replaced with another that had very different priorities from their predecessor."
  koa.109.a:0 "Together in freedom… At least until the next election."

  koa.110.t:0 "Abdication Day"
  koa.110.d:0 "Once he had finished laying out his final edicts for his kingdom, Maximillian Acorn announced that he was finally stepping down in favor of his son Elias. There was cause for much rejoicing in the land, both from the people who were glad to see Maximilian the Cursed retire and those who looked forward to how the young regent would set their nation straight.\nNot all in the country saw this as a change for the better. Nobody in the right mind thought it was a good idea for Max to sit on the throne a day longer, but Elias Acorn was only barely of age to inherit his father's crown. The Acorn monarchy was an ancient institution, burdened by the mistakes of rulers both past and present. Elias was by all accounts a man of good nature, but who would hold the latest Acorn accountable if the burden of absolute power transformed him into a very different person?\nOn that day, several influential people saw the favor of Prince Elias over the much more seasoned Princess Sally as the last straw. From the growing workers' unions of the Titanium Belt to the rising populist movements in the Baronies, the idea that Prince Elias will not be the man to save the country dug in and quickly gained traction.\nThere would be no greater source of revolutionary fervor than that which was brewing in the heart of New Mobotropolis itself. The Prowers knew that Elias Acorn did not have what it took to lead the kingdom on his own. This time, they would not be silenced. As of Abdication Day, they began their preparations to make their demands for political reform known to the entire world."
  koa.110.a:0 "Good luck, King Elias. You're gonna need it."

  koa.111.t:0 "The Coronation of Elias Acorn"
  koa.111.d:0 "A new King of Acorns has been crowned! After King Maximilian Acorn’s abdication -- citing issues related to his physical and mental wellbeing -- his long lost son, Elias, took the throne. His coronation was an elaborate ceremony, broadcast for public viewing.\nThe former king was in attendance, as were the Freedom Fighters, multiple officers of the military, and some special forces agents. The event was met with mixed responses from within the Kingdom and the international community at large, but it drew in record ratings. There’s no telling what Elias’s reign will be like, but it certainly won’t be easy!"
  koa.111.a:0 "We’ll be watching his career with great interest."
  koa.111.b:0 "The boy is doomed!"
