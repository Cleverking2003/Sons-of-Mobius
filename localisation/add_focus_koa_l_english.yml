  KOA_Alexanders_Legacy:0 "Alexander's Legacy"
  KOA_Alexanders_Legacy_desc:0 "King Alexander the Unifier was the first King of Acorn, who brought the tribes of Northamer together. We have seen his vision nearly die once before, but the kingdom will not fall while Max holds the throne."

  KOA_Theodores_Grief:0 "Theodore's Grief"
  KOA_Theodores_Grief_desc:0 "While his kingdom prospered, King Theodore the Bereaved lost his son to a tragic accident. An overlander youth shot his son, and Theodore closed borders with the Overland while mourning. We must ensure that our Kingdom will not be the victims of unknown weapons or be consumed by whatever tragedy may one day befall it."

  KOA_Raphaels_Preparations:0 "Raphael's Preparations"
  KOA_Raphaels_Preparations_desc:0 "King Raphael, second son of King Theodore, was forced to the throne as a child when his father died unexpectedly. He spent most of his reign preparing his child for his time in power. We must implement a draft and train the troops so that our soldiers are ready for future warfare."

  KOA_Studies_of_Julius:0 "Studies of Julius"
  KOA_Studies_of_Julius_desc:0 "King Julius the Enlightened (not to be confused with that traitor Robotnik) was the first to discover the Source of All, the heavenly force that brought us prosperity until its demise. While the Source of All may no longer be with us, we should still invest money into more mundane discoveries. Our enemies won’t stay idle, and neither should we."

  KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus:0 "Constructions of Romulus"
  KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus_desc:0 "King Romulus the Builder moved the capital to the Source of All’s resting place. He built up the power of the monarchy, as well as Mobotropolis itself. The decades have not been kind to our industry, but we must restore our production to the level at which we can compete with the Robosphere."

  KOA_Lessons_from_George:0 "Lessons from George"
  KOA_Lessons_from_George_desc:0 "For all of the respect you have for your predecessors, King George the Foolish earned his title by leading a disastrous war against the Overland and losing the support of his court in the process. Now we are in a situation where we too must gamble the support of the people, knowing that our favor has gone into decline. Taxes will have to be raised in expectation of a very just war. The people may not like it, but they will come to understand its necessity in time."

  KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham:0 "Gifts of Abraham"
  KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham_desc:0 "King Abraham the Generous rebuilt the trust of the masses by establishing the baronies and healing the wounds caused by King George’s Folly. Several of the Barons rebelled against the Kingdom and sided with the Overlanders during the Great War, so we will be far more careful with our generosity. Rewards will be given to the loyal. Treasoners will receive naught but the sword."

  KOA_Passion_of_Reginald:0 "Passion of Reginald"
  KOA_Passion_of_Reginald_desc:0 "King Reginald the Romantic got his name from his marriage to a woman he met while visiting the colony of Downunda and his love of the arts. He was a terrible poet, but the kingdom benefited from his appreciation of cultural explorations. War has strained the Kingdom of Acorn’s relationship with their colonial city of Priscilla for too long. Now they can once again benefit from our support and patronage."

  KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus:0 "Strength of Silvanus"
  KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus_desc:0 "While his actions to strengthen the Kingdom of Acorn made King Silvanus the Resolute a controversial figure, he did what he had to in order to prevent the Overland from preying upon any perceived weaknesses. We too will steel ourselves in expectation of the worst and protect our nation accordingly."

  KOA_Sebastians_Allies:0 "Sebastian’s Allies"
  KOA_Sebastians_Allies_desc:0 "The Adventurer King, Sebastian the Worldly, traveled the globe during his reign. His most notable accomplishment was supporting the O’Hedge family during the power struggle that consumed Eurish generations ago, securing the throne for his allies and giving birth to modern Mercia. The Kingdom of Acorn will reestablish ties with their old friends before trouble rears its ugly head again."

  KOA_Frederics_Open_Mind:0 "Frederic’s Open Mind"
  KOA_Frederics_Open_Mind_desc:0 "Father of Maximilian Acorn, King Frederic the Gracious was the first king to give an earnest effort at peace with the Overland. That peace was never to be, but the humans of the United Federation have proven to be trustworthy allies against Robotnik’s regime. It would not hurt to strengthen those ties in expectation of further hardship."

  KOA_Maximilians_Remorse:0 "Maximilian’s Remorse"
  KOA_Maximilians_Remorse_desc:0 "King Maximilian is not so far gone that he is unaware of his title: King Max the Cursed. He owns his great error in trusting Doctor Robotnik with the keys to his kingdom and the atrocities Julian committed with them. He placed his trust in the wrong people too many times before, but not this time. Before he steps down, his kingdom will be ready to make Eggman bleed!"

  KOA_Gift_to_Elias:0 "Gift to Elias"
  KOA_Gift_to_Elias_desc:0 "We have done everything we could to prepare the Kingdom of Acorn for its next heir. King Max feels the exhaustion from his long years of strife, and has come to the end of his reign. He will step down in favor of his son, and Elias Acorn will lead the kingdom towards a new era."

  KOA_Put_Out_The_Fires:0 "Put Out the Fires"
  KOA_Put_Out_The_Fires_desc:0 "To say that King Elias’ coronation is a contentious event would be an understatement. People are mad and things aren’t likely to get better in the coming days, so we must do everything possible to ensure that our regime remains stable. Pose for pictures, shake hands, kiss babies, anything to convince the populace that King Elias was the proper choice for Max’s successor."

  KOA_Ease_the_Concerns:0 "Ease the Concerns"
  KOA_Ease_the_Concerns_desc:0 "The people have no reason to be concerned! King Elias is a kind and generous ruler who only wants what’s best for his kingdom, even if that requires a few hard decisions to be made. We may live in challenging times, but we’ve endured worse! Compared to our struggles under Robotnik, a simple regime change is nothing! Ignore the doubters, Elias is the only one who can lead us to the future!"

  KOA_Silence_the_Doubters:0 "Silence the Doubters"
  KOA_Silence_the_Doubters_desc:0 "There have been some unfortunate naysayers to the king's ascension that refuse to be reasoned with. Ignore their doomsaying, as their negativity is poisoning the discourse for everyone. Elias is king. What other options are there but to have faith in the fact that our regent will lead us to victory? Suggestions to those alternatives will not be tolerated in the streets of New Mobotropolis."

  KOA_Support_Worker_Rights:0 "Support Worker Rights"
  KOA_Support_Worker_Rights_desc:0 "Rumors of slackening safety regulations and mounting worker complaints in the factories have reached Castle Acorn. This is unacceptable. If we allow our people to toil like slaves in our factories, how are we better than our enemies? Our workers are our subjects. They have well earned a set of basic rights to keep them safe from hazardous work conditions and exploitative wages."

  KOA_Negotiate_with_Union_Leaders:0 "Negotiate with Union Leaders"
  KOA_Negotiate_with_Union_Leaders_desc:0 "We have become aware of larger movers and shakers at work in the growing labor unions of the Titanium Belt. It would do well to make contact with these influential union leaders to ensure that the needs of the kingdom's industrial workers are properly met, though they may be skeptical at first of the new regent's intentions for them."

  KOA_Suppress_Organized_Labor:0 "Suppress Organized Labor"
  KOA_Suppress_Organized_Labor_desc:0 "The factory workers of the North have started to form cliques and undermine our efforts to prepare the country for Eggman's eventual attack. This cannot stand. We will muster a garrison to halt these activities and provide incentives for more workers to leave their seditious activities."

  KOA_Bust_Northern_Unions:0 "Bust Northern Unions"
  KOA_Bust_Northern_Unions_desc:0 "It is no big secret that there are leaders organizing the worker strikes and acts of sabotage that have become a growing issue in the Titanium Belt. Increase the pressure on the Northamer unions and arrest the leaders before their actions cause anyone else to get hurt."

  KOA_Uphold_Barony_System:0 "Uphold Barony System"
  KOA_Uphold_Barony_System_desc:0 "While the betrayals committed by some barons during the Great War have caused some to question the value of keeping them around, the Southern Baronies have been an institution for centuries. To revoke the hereditary rights of those barons who survived and remained loyal would ruffle the fur of the few Southern nobles that remain. We will announce that the Barony system is being upheld as before to prevent them from getting any wrong ideas."

  KOA_Appeal_to_Populists:0 "Appeal to Populists"
  KOA_Appeal_to_Populists_desc:0 "As shown by the tales of kings past (and the king that recently retired), a disconnect with the wants and needs of the people can be disastrous. Lend an ear to the requests of the more active populist movements in the Southern Baronies. If we can win back the crowd, we can win back the kingdom!"

  KOA_Sideline_the_Barons:0 "Sideline the Barons"
  KOA_Sideline_the_Barons_desc:0 "The Southern Barons have been unreliable in the past. To let them get too powerful means that their loyalty to the Kingdom of Acorn may start to slip like it did when the Overland offered to split the country fifty-fifty. Limit the influence of the surviving Barons and keep their powers in check to prevent anything like that from happening again."

  KOA_Revoke_Baron_Titles:0 "Revoke Baron Titles"
  KOA_Revoke_Baron_Titles:0 "The baronies are an antiquated system that serves only to take undue power from the king and invite the barons to organize against their kingdom. Curtailing the barons' influence on the South is the first step to properly reintegrating the Baronies back into the Kingdom of Acorn."
