  KOA_Alexanders_Legacy:0 "Наследие Александра"
  KOA_Alexanders_Legacy_desc:0 "Король Александр Объединитель был первым Королём Акорна, объединившим племена Нортамера. И хотя его планы однажды едва не порушились, королевство не падёт, пока Макс остаётся у трона."

  KOA_Theodores_Grief:0 "Горесть Теодора"
  KOA_Theodores_Grief_desc:0 "В то время как королевство его процветало, Король Теодор Скорбящий теряет сына в трагическом происшествии. Его застрелил юный оверлендер, и теперь Теодор закрыл границы с Оверлендом, оплакивая его. Мы должны быть уверены, что наше Королевство не пострадает от неизвестного оружия или не будет поглощено какой-либо трагедией, которая однажды может снизойти на него."

  KOA_Raphaels_Preparations:0 "Приготовления Рафаэля"
  KOA_Raphaels_Preparations_desc:0 "Король Рафаэль, второй сын Короля Теодора, был вынужден взойти на трон ещё ребёнком из-за внезапной кончины своего отца. Почти всё время своего правления он готовил сына к тому, чтобы он сам стал правителем. Мы должны провести призыв и обучение войск, чтобы наши солдаты были готовы к будущей войне."

  KOA_Studies_of_Julius:0 "Studies of Julius"
  KOA_Studies_of_Julius_desc:0 "King Julius the Enlightened (not to be confused with that traitor Robotnik) was the first to discover the Source of All, the heavenly force that brought us prosperity until its demise. While the Source of All may no longer be with us, we should still invest money into more mundane discoveries. Our enemies won’t stay idle, and neither should we."

  KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus:0 "Constructions of Romulus"
  KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus_desc:0 "King Romulus the Builder moved the capital to the Source of All’s resting place. He built up the power of the monarchy, as well as Mobotropolis itself. The decades have not been kind to our industry, but we must restore our production to the level at which we can compete with the Robosphere."

  KOA_Lessons_from_George:0 "Lessons from George"
  KOA_Lessons_from_George_desc:0 "For all of the respect you have for your predecessors, King George the Foolish earned his title by leading a disastrous war against the Overland and losing the support of his court in the process. Now we are in a situation where we too must gamble the support of the people, knowing that our favor has gone into decline. Taxes will have to be raised in expectation of a very just war. The people may not like it, but they will come to understand its necessity in time."

  KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham:0 "Gifts of Abraham"
  KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham_desc:0 "King Abraham the Generous rebuilt the trust of the masses by establishing the baronies and healing the wounds caused by King George’s Folly. Several of the Barons rebelled against the Kingdom and sided with the Overlanders during the Great War, so we will be far more careful with our generosity. Rewards will be given to the loyal. Treasoners will receive naught but the sword."

  KOA_Passion_of_Reginald:0 "Passion of Reginald"
  KOA_Passion_of_Reginald_desc:0 "King Reginald the Romantic got his name from his marriage to a woman he met while visiting the colony of Downunda and his love of the arts. He was a terrible poet, but the kingdom benefited from his appreciation of cultural explorations. War has strained the Kingdom of Acorn’s relationship with their colonial city of Priscilla for too long. Now they can once again benefit from our support and patronage."

  KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus:0 "Strength of Silvanus"
  KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus_desc:0 "While his actions to strengthen the Kingdom of Acorn made King Silvanus the Resolute a controversial figure, he did what he had to in order to prevent the Overland from preying upon any perceived weaknesses. We too will steel ourselves in expectation of the worst and protect our nation accordingly."

  KOA_Sebastians_allies:0 "Sebastian’s Allies"
  KOA_Sebastians_allies_desc:0 "The Adventurer King, Sebastian the Worldly, traveled the globe during his reign. His most notable accomplishment was supporting the O’Hedge family during the power struggle that consumed Eurish generations ago, securing the throne for his allies and giving birth to modern Mercia. The Kingdom of Acorn will reestablish ties with their old friends before trouble rears its ugly head again."

  KOA_Frederics_open_mind:0 "Frederic’s Open Mind"
  KOA_Frederics_open_mind_desc:0 "Father of Maximilian Acorn, King Frederic the Gracious was the first king to give an earnest effort at peace with the Overland. That peace was never to be, but the humans of the United Federation have proven to be trustworthy allies against Robotnik’s regime. It would not hurt to strengthen those ties in expectation of further hardship."

  KOA_Maximilians_remorse:0 "Maximilian’s Remorse"
  KOA_Maximilians_remorse_desc:0 "King Maximilian is not so far gone that he is unaware of his title: King Max the Cursed. He owns his great error in trusting Doctor Robotnik with the keys to his kingdom and the atrocities Julian committed with them. He placed his trust in the wrong people too many times before, but not this time. Before he steps down, his kingdom will be ready to make Eggman bleed!"

  KOA_Gift_to_Elias:0 "Gift to Elias"
  KOA_Gift_to_Elias_desc:0 "We have done everything we could to prepare the Kingdom of Acorn for its next heir. King Max feels the exhaustion from his long years of strife, and has come to the end of his reign. He will step down in favor of his son, and Elias Acorn will lead the kingdom towards a new era."
